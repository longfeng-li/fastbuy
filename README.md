Time-limited Sales Promotion is a very popular commercial activity held by online retailers in e-commerce. Providing reliable and timely responses to large scale of concurrent requests is thus crucial. Our project aims to build a Time-limited Sales Promotion System which can handle numerous concurrent customers' orders on different products within limited time.
